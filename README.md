## Copy-Move Image Tampering Detection

Copy-move image tampering is a type of digital image manipulation where a portion of an image is copied and pasted onto another area of the same image in order to conceal or duplicate an object or area. Copy-move image tampering detection refers to the process of detecting this type of manipulation in images.

### Overview

This project aims to build a deep learning model to detect copy-move image tampering in digital images. The model will be trained on a dataset of images with known tampering, and will be able to classify new images as either tampered or not tampered.

The project will be implemented using Python and various machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

### Dataset

The model will be trained on a publicly available dataset of images with known copy-move tampering. The dataset can be obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divg07/casia-20-image-tampering-detection-dataset).

### Methodology

The following steps will be followed to develop the model:

1. Preprocessing: The images will be preprocessed by applying various image processing techniques such as resizing, cropping, normalization, and converting to ELA form.

2. Feature Extraction: Features such as color, texture, and shape will be extracted from the preprocessed images.

3. Model Development: A deep learning model will be developed using TensorFlow and Keras. The model will be trained on the extracted features using various deep learning architectures such as CNN using Relu, LeakyRelu, Swish, ResNet, and VGG-16.

4. Model Evaluation: The performance of the model will be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. Deployment: The trained model will be deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

### Conclusion

Copy-move image tampering is a common form of image manipulation, and detecting it is an important task in digital forensics. Developing an accurate and reliable model for detecting this type of manipulation can help to prevent the spread of fake or misleading images.
